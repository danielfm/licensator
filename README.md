# Licensator - The Open Source License Adviser

Licensator is a little web application written just for fun in about
48 hours.

## About Licensator

If you do some research, you'll find that there are
[literally hundreds][oss-licenses]  of open source licenses. Most of
them are not used anymore, or are superseded by other licenses, or are
incompatible with other licenses.

As you can see, things can get ugly. That's why we wrote this app.

## Prerequisites

* [Clojure][clj] 1.3.0;
* [Leiningen][lein] 1.7.0.


## Running Licensator

Just run `lein run` to compile the app and start a local
[Jetty][jetty] instance.
